MAYASEC: AI-Driven Deceptive Cybersecurity Platform
MAYASEC is an advanced cybersecurity framework designed to proactively detect, engage, and analyze cyber threats through sophisticated deception techniques and AI-driven honeypot modules. Built with Python, MAYASEC empowers defenders to stay ahead of attackers by simulating vulnerable environments, capturing adversary behaviors, and leveraging machine learning to continuously adapt intrusion detection capabilities.

Features
Multi-Protocol Honeypots: Includes advanced SSH and HTTP honeypots with configurable deception layers and real-time monitoring.

AI Agent Integration: Employs agent-based architecture for automated threat analysis, response, and adaptive deception.

Behavioral Analytics: Tracks attacker Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) using Markov-chain modeling and continuous learning.

Easy API Management: Seamless integration with Gemini and other APIs; environment configuration managed via .env files for security and scalability.

Educational Utilities: Designed as a platform for learning and teaching cybersecurity through hands-on practice and dynamic scenario generation (compatible with platforms like picoCTF).

Extensible Architecture: Modular design to easily add new honeypots, deception modules, and AI/ML analysis agents.
